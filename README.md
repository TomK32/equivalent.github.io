### I want a blog too !

If you are planing to create your own blog website (for your own good) please don't fork and
publish this repo (As I've made lot of custom changes like hardcoded
google analitic links, Disqus ids ...) That means it will just be more
work for you to remove these hardcoded parts out.

Rather consider generating new project from scratch with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
lib as this is what this blog is using.

### Development

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
